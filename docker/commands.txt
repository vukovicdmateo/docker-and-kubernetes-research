docker run <image name> -> try to create and run a container based of an image
docker run <image name> <startup command> -> overriding the default command
docker ps -> list all running containers
docker ps --all -> list all containers
docker run = docker create + docker start
docker start <container id> -> start a container
docker start -a <container id> -> start a container but also attach the output
of it to our terminal
docker system prune -> delete eveyrthing (images, containers,...)
docker logs -> retrieve all information that was emited (outputed) 
from a container
docker stop <container id > -> Stops a running container but gives 
him a little time for cleanup work
docker kill <container id > -> Stops a running container immediately
docker exec -it <container id> <command> -> execute another command 
inside a running container, -it means thet it is interactive, so 
you can type in the terminal to talk to the container
-it = -i + -t
-i -> interactive
-t -> pretty format
docker exec -it <container id> sh -> we get full terminal access inside the
context of a container
docker run -it <image> sh -> get the terminal on starting of a container
exit -> exit the terminal of a container
docker build . -> build a docker image froma docker file in the current folder
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 docker build . -> disable the new buldkit feature, useful
if you follow a tutorial without the new buildkit feature and want to see the
same output
docker build -t <dockerId:projectName:version> . -> tagging an image (giving it a name)
docker run -p 8080:8080 <image id/name> -> port mapping, first port is local port, second 
one is container port
docker image ls -> list all top level images
docker rmi -f $(docker images -aq) -> remove all docker images
docker-compose up -> start containers
docker-compose up -d -> launch in background, -d can also be used for normal run command
docker-compose up --build -> rebuild images and start containers
docker-compose down -> stops all running containers and deltese them as well
docker-compose ps -> see running containers from docker-compose
